 <div id="first"> Pets are not human but display a lot of human qualities like strong personalities, emotions, preferences, etc. While pets are mere domesticated animals for those who do not possess them, for those few who do they are not just dogs, cats, or birds; they are family.

      Despite the odds favouring owners outliving their pets, pet owners are inclined to keep on getting themselves new pets when the old ones pass away. If one has been the receiver of unconditional love and affection from a pet and has enjoyed a pets undemanding companionship then one is addicted for life.<div>

<div id="second" > Pets work wonders for your body, soul, and mind. They stimulate your sense of well-being. They give you love, they give you laughter, but above all they give you happiness. They dont care about your looks, your financial status, your social standing, your creed, your race, your age, your state of health. They see you for who you are; minus the trappings of your daily existence. It is probably this quality of unconditional acceptance that sets pets apart from humans .
      Some people are cat people, some are dog people.  But regardless of which camp they fall into, most people are simply crazy about their pets.  The connections people form with their cats and dogs are often the longest, strongest relationships in their lives.  They are our soul mates, our best friends, sometimes even our surrogate children.  What makes these creatures such key members of our families<div>

<div id="third"> Perhaps its because our furry friends have long provided us with comfort, camaraderie, and unconditional love. Cats and dogs are our unending source of kisses, cuddles, slobber, claws, and laughs.<div>
