The domestic dog is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

<div id="first">Although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole,[4] golden jackal,[5] or gray wolf[6]), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago.[7] Being the oldest domesticated animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[8] as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species.[9]
Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In China and South Vietnam dogs are a source of meat for humans.<div>
<div id="second"><h2><b><u>Origin</h2></b></u>
The origin of the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is not clear. Whole genome sequencing indicates that the dog, the gray wolf and the extinct Taymyr wolf diverged at around the same time 27,000–40,000 years ago.[7] These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists.[31] Modern dogs are more closely related to ancient wolf fossils that have been found in Europe than they are to modern gray wolves.[32] Nearly all dog breeds' genetic closeness to the gray wolf are due to admixture,[31] except several Arctic dog breeds are close to the Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture.<div>
<div id="third"><h2><b><u> AS PETS </h2></b></u>
It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.[79]

"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs"[113] and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.[119] (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together).[120] However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[119] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today[121] (using the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[122] People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives,[123] to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.

There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.[124] The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[124]
There are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[125] The list of goods, services and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.[125] While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking (which dogs do to establish territory through scent), became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.[126] Dog training books, classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[127]
<br>
The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family,[124] although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack.[124] A dominance model of dog–human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer<div>
